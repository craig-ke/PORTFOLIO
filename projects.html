       Check out <a href=" https://www.amazon.com/ ">Amazon</a> Is the leading online platform for 
       selling various things. They have motivated me to starting my own nonine shopping mall
       that  will be beneficial to the people of my country. Having the ability o buy things online and being 
       delivered in time is such a relieving feeling to the customers.</li>

          <h3>Nguruma app</h3>
        For the drivers in Kenya, people are having such a hard time to trade their vehicles in a secure 
        environment, This app would not only enable the seller to sell his vehicle but also buy vehicle of choice
        at a fair price.How enticing is that sound?Work made easier</li>
